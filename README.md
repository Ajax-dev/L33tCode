# L33tCode
This repository will be for the containing of all solutions I attempt for L33tCode problems, I will begin with Java and Python and hopefully gradually move onto C++ aswell.
Currently I'm testing the pushing of a branch directly from VSCode with Ubuntu 22.04.

To run either python or java you must open the folder specifically with VSCode as the environments can't juggle python and java at the same time so has to be one or the other.
